            <h2 class="sub-header" id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The gameplay is centred upon a <em>mobage</em>-like card battle game, with individual characters represented by various cards with different attributes. Each of the characters are moe anthropomorphisms of World War II naval warships which are depicted as cute girls, known as "Fleet girls" (艦娘 <em>kanmusu</em>). These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger displacement tonnage are sometimes depicted with larger breasts, with the notable exception of a few aircraft carriers). The player takes on the role of an admiral (提督 <em>teitoku</em>) and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing. The player can organise up to four different fleets.</p>
            <p>The player progresses through the game by advancing through maps, gaining experience points through grinding, obtaining new fleet girls whilst repairing and resupplying existing ones, and fulfilling quests to obtain resources. New equipment can be crafted, allowing the fleet girls to equip different armaments depending on the situation. Acquisition of new <em>kanmusu</em> by the player can occur via drops on map or via crafting, and is heavily RNG-based; randomisation is also a key component of the battle mechanism, map progression and equipment development. Construction, resupply and repair of ships is reliant upon four types of resources, namely fuel, ammunition, steel and bauxite; these supplies will gradually increase automatically as time passes. Players can choose to engage in expeditions, sorties and quests to further increase their supplies as well.</p>
            <p>Ships can be customised through the addition of various equipment within their empty slots, which add attribute bonuses and even provide special effects in some cases; such equipment include naval guns, anti-aircraft guns, torpedoes, torpedo bombers, dive bombers, fighter aircraft, seaplanes, recon planes, radars, steam turbines, special artillery shells, depth charges, sonars, drum canisters, searchlights and anti-torpedo bulges. The effectiveness of ships in combat depend on its attribute parameters, namely hitpoints, armour, evasion, aircraft capacity, speed, attack range, firepower, torpedo, anti-air, anti-submarine, line-of-sight, and luck.</p>
            <p><em>kanmusu</em> are capable of becoming stronger as they gain experience and level up after battles, and can also be remodeled into more advanced models once they reach a certain level. Unwanted <em>kanmusu</em> can also be "fed" to other <em>kanmusu</em> through a process known as "modernisation" (近代化改修 <em>kindaika kaishu</em>), which grants attribute bonuses to one ship in exchange for losing another. Ships can become fatigued once it accumulates after sorties; fatigued ships have decreased attributes, whilst sparkling ships have increased attributes. Fatigue can be alleviated by allowing ships some time to rest, or by recovering the fleet's morale using Japanese food supply ship Mamiya. As ships become damaged, their icons begin to blow off smoke and their clothing become visually torn and battered; in the event when a ship's durability drops down to zero, it is considered sunk, and the player will lose the fleet girl. Players cannot resurrect fleet girls that have been lost unless they are in possession of an emergency repair item, and are only able to re-train ships that have been lost from scratch.</p>
            <p>Whilst the game is free-to-play, special premium bonuses can be obtained through prepaid game money and credit card micropayments, such as repair dock expansions, home shipyard furniture tokens, ship possession limit increases and special consumable items. Although each ship in the game has an experience level cap of Lv.99, the player is able to obtain the "marriage papers and ring" item with a monetary purchase priced at 700 yen or via a one-time special quest, which allows the player to "marry" the girl, thereby breaking the original level cap and allowing a new maximum of Lv.150, in addition to other perks such as stat boosts and decreased operating costs; this process can be repeated as many times as the player wishes, and there is no limit to the number of girls that can be "married".</p>
            <p>Players can choose to battle against the fleets of other real-life players on the same game server via the exercise maneuvers menu. Players are also able to compete with each other's scores via in-game ranking boards, with periodical prizes for top ranking players. As of June 2014, there are 18 servers that can be played on, each named after a World War II-era Japanese naval base. The game is currently intended to be played by a Japanese domestic audience only, with the interface exclusively in the Japanese language. As of present, the game cannot be played outside of Japan without the use of a VPN; utilisation of such methods to circumvent country IP restrictions and access the game breach the DMM.com online game terms of use, however. From August 2013 onwards, new player registrations are only available via periodic lottery, due to the servers being overloaded by large numbers of new registrants.</p>

            <h3 id="shiptype">Ship types</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Battleship</strong> (戦艦: Have strong power and defense, whilst requiring large quantities of resources. A battleship on either side grants a second attack turn for both the player and enemy fleets.</li>
              <li><strong>Aircraft carrier</strong> (正規空母: Allows for preemptive aerial strikes before battles. Have long repair times, are expensive to maintain, and the planes require bauxite. Cannot attack at night.</li>

              <li><strong>Seaplane carrier</strong> (水上機母艦: High enemy formation detection stats. Largely weak. Can be equipped with midget submarines and seaplanes, and can attack submarines. Can also be remodeled into light aircraft carriers.</li>
              <li><strong>Heavy cruiser</strong> (重巡洋艦: Able to deal significant damage, and are fuel efficient. Have decent overall stats, however does not excel in any particular areas.</li>
              <li><strong>Light cruiser</strong> (軽巡洋艦: Strong anti-submarine type, effective during night combat. Have low endurance, and serve as a support role. Though slightly stronger than destroyers, firepower and armour is still limited. Cheap to maintain.</li>
              <li><strong>Destroyer</strong> (駆逐艦: Good for night battles and anti-submarine warfare, in addition to being cheap to maintain with their good fuel and repair rate. Boasts a high evasion rate, however also have low armour and firepower.</li>
              <li><strong>Torpedo cruiser</strong> (重雷装巡洋艦: Remodeled from certain light cruisers. Capable of deploying midget submarines, allowing a preemptive torpedo strike.</li>
              <li><strong>Submarine</strong> (潜水艦: Have low health and limited damage output from its torpedo attacks, however use very small amounts of resources, and can only be attacked by certain ship types. Have a high evasion rate, however are weak against ships equipped with depth charges or sonar. Capable of attacking preemptively.</li>
              <li><strong>Submarine aircraft carrier</strong> (潜水空母: Capable of carrying seaplanes.</li>
              <li><strong>Aviation battleship</strong> (航空戦艦: Remodeled from certain battleships. Deals less firepower than standard battleships, however can equip seaplane bombers which are able to attack submarines.</li>
              <li><strong>Aviation cruiser</strong> (航空巡洋艦: Remodeled from certain heavy cruisers. Can equip seaplane bombers which are able to attack submarines.</li>
              <li><strong>Amphibious warfare ship</strong> (揚陸艦: Largely useless during combat. Autogyros play an anti-submarine role, whilst equipped landing crafts add a resource bonus to expeditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Repair ship</strong> (工作艦: When placed within a fleet, gradually repair other ships within the fleet over time, similar to a repair dock.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            It is planned for <strong>coastal defense ships</strong> (海防艦) to be eventually added to the game in future; the developers anticipate that these ships will play an anti-submarine role, and will feature a more cute and childish character design, reason being that coastal defense ships are smaller in size compared to destroyers.
            </p>
            <!-- part 2.2 -->
            <h3 id="fleetgirl">Fleet girls</h3>
            <p id="gameplay_end">Upon the debut of the game, there were a total of 94 different fleet girls available. Within an update introduced May 15–17, 2013, additional fleet girls were added. On September 11, 2013 the first non-Japanese vessel, Soviet destroyer Verniy (Верный), was introduced into the game. There were plans during the early stages to eventually bring additional ships from other countries, and in March 2014, three German Kriegsmarine vessels were added. Presently there are 135 original girls in addition to 45 upgraded variants, bringing the total number of fleet girls to 180. The game currently holds spaces for 200 different types of fleet girls. Different fleet girls are illustrated by different artists; artists involved in the drawing of various characters include Shibafu, Shizuma Yoshinori, Konishi, Kūrokuro, Mikoto Akemi and 9 other artists. Fumikane Shimada, who was previously the lead character designer for Strike Witches and Girls und Panzer, created the designs and illustrations for Japanese armored aircraft carrier Taihō and the three German vessels.</p>
            <p id="plot_pre">The traits of each fleet girl are based on aspects of the historical ship they are based on; for instance, Japanese battleship Kongō frequently adds English words and phrases into her dialog as a reference to her British origins, whilst Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi is depicted as a glutton and Japanese destroyer Shimakaze is depicted as a speedy girl in artworks and official print media, since the <em>Akagi</em> consumed large amounts of fuel and the Shimakaze was one of the fastest destroyer ships of World War II. Characters which share particular links also have similar physical traits: ships of the same class may have similar accessories or clothing, whilst all submarines are depicted as wearing sukumizu.</p>
            <p>Voice actors have been employed to voice the fleet girls, with anywhere around 10 fleet girls being voiced by one actor. The complete list of voice actors involved has not yet been published.</p>
            <!-- part 3 -->
            <h2 class="sub-header" id="plot">Plot</h2>
            <p>Whilst the original game does not have a particular storyline, and largely focuses on gameplay, each of the official media works feature various settings with separate and differing canons. Not only do the stories differ, but also the depictions and interpretations of fleet girls and the manner in which they engage in combat. The game does not strictly define anything relating to its setting, allowing for a greater diversity of secondary literary adaptation works which cater to different audiences.</p>
            <!-- part 3.1 -->
            <h3 id="cranes"><em>KanColle: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes</em></h3>
            <p>Within the story of Bonds of the Wings of Cranes, the setting is within an alternate universe where World War II never took place. The fleet of the Abyss, consisting of monster ships, lock down access to the seas and indiscriminately fire upon vessels and aircraft, and feed on the corpses of dead sailors in the water. Ship girls are the guardians of humanity and human-weapon hybrids that are summoned using spirit energy (霊力, with female forms as the ships they represent have female souls. Zuikaku, having taken a humanoid form, remembers a time where she was once a ship, however does not know the reason behind her human form.</p>
            <p>The fleet girls live within an old-fashioned Japanese-style hotel which doubles as the girls' dormitory, and is close to a nearby factory which services combat equipment. The admiral of the fleet is a young man who behaves like a pervert, fond of groping the ship girls and playing with their skirts, although his personality does become serious when commanding the fleet. As the ship girls and abyssal fleets engage in combat, both sides are guarded by a protective barrier. The aircraft carriers Akagi and Kaga are depicted as firing archery arrows from a bow which then transform into fighter planes. Armaments are detachable equipment, and when not in combat gear the ships otherwise appear as ordinary girls.</p>

            <h3 id="kagero"><em>KanColle: Kagerō, Setting Sail!</em></h3>
            <p>This light novel is set within a universe based on the real world, where normal girls undergo training to become ship girls.</p>

            <h3 id="calm"><em>KanColle: Someday as the Seas turn Calm</em></h3>
            <p id="plot_end">This manga adaptation focuses on the adventures of the Tenryū Torpedo Squadron as they engage in search and destroy patrols and respond to distress calls. Within this manga, ship girls are depicted as flying on the water surface whilst in combat against the abyss fleet of monster ships, and launch aircraft managed by tiny fairies in a conventional takeoff manner from their body attachments. Artillery and torpedo combat is shown to be performed at long range, whilst anti-submarine warfare takes place in close quarters.</p>
            <!-- part 3.4 -->
            <h3 id="shimakaze"><em>KanColle: Shimakaze Whirlwind Girl</em></h3>
            <p id="reception_pre">This manga depicts the story of a newly appointed, rookie officer by the name of Ensign Akai who arrives at the Maizuru Naval Base for duty as the assistant to the vice-admiral, however has to deal with a stubborn and difficult Shimakaze who spends most of her time alone, and does not have any friends.</p>
            <!-- part 3.5 -->
            <h3 id="fubuki"><em>KanColle: Fubuki, Ganbarimasu!</em></h3>
            <p>This slice of life 4koma depicts the everyday life of the ship girls at the fleet training school, where newly manufactured ship girls spend one year learning knowledge before setting out to sea. Most of the scenarios are taken from the point of view of Fubuki, and feature the girls doing fun things with one another, which include attending school, drinking tea, celebrating various holidays like Tanabata, Halloween and Christmas, in addition to the occasional sortie. The ship girls retain memories of their previous lives from World War II, at times displaying signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. References to their personal histories and characteristics are common and usually used to comedic effect. This manga depicts the ship girls as being able to walk on the surface of the water in a manner akin to ice-skating.</p>

                <p>Due to the high popularity of the game within Japan, game operators have created larger numbers of servers within early 2013 to account for the influx of players. During August 2013, the number of new players spiked by 100,000 people within one week, to a total of 600,000 people, with 350,000 daily active players. By September 2013, it was reported that there were more than 800,000 players that were regularly active. The total number of players broke past 1,000,000 on 9 October 2013.

            <p>Various unintended consequences have arisen domestically as a result of this significantly large playerbase, such as its disproportional influence over the technological sector in Japan. According to a report by research firm BCN, the market share of Microsoft Windows tablets in Japan suddenly rose to 15% during the calendar year of 2013—a five-fold increase over the previous year—and that no such trend is occurring anywhere else outside Japan; this rise is partially attributed to the inability to properly play Kantai Collection on Android devices, the largest competitor to Windows tablet devices in Japan.</p>

            <h3 id="culture">Cultural trends and industry reception</h3>
            <p>Interest in Kantai Collection has significantly risen over the months following its release, to the point where it has often been compared with the fandom of Touhou Project as an emerging viral fandom. There has been a large increase in online activity and fan-created material relating to the game, such as fan-made artworks, doujinshi and other derivative content. As of April 2014, there are over 150,000 different artworks on Pixiv tagged with "KanColle" created by 38,000 individual artists, and KanColle-related videos on Niconico were watched 69.7 million times. During Comiket 85, there were 1,136 dōjin circles producing works for Kantai Collection, placing third behind Touhou Project (2,272 circles) and Kuroko's Basketball (1,462 circles), and ahead of The Idolmaster and Vocaloid; this is a significant increase over the previous Comiket 84 event, which only had just over 100 circles with Kantai Collection works. Dōjin material relating to the game have also gained traction overseas; KanColle-exclusive dōjin events have been held in Shanghai on 22 February 2014, and Taipei on 29 March 2014.</p>

                <p>On 12 December 2013, Twitter officially released the top hashtags of 2013; #艦これ was the most used hashtag among Japanese Twitter users. The game was also the eighth most searched term within Japan on Google in 2013. On 30 December 2013, GameSpark named Kantai Collection as the online game category title for its game of the year awards of 2013, ahead of runners-up League of Legends, World of Tanks and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.

                <p>conducted by 4gamer asked what each developer considered to be the best game of 2013; nine of these developers selected Kantai Collection. Among these developers, Naoki Yoshida of Square Enix, who produced and directed Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, stated that Kantai Collection is Japan's answer to World of Tanks, and that he was impressed by the business model; meanwhile, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA director Seiji Hayashi of Sega referred to the game as "innovative". Kantai Collection was named "Rookie of the Year" during the WebMoney 2013 Awards, as a new entrant to the games market.</p>

            <h3 id="finance">Financial reception and sales figures</h3>
            <p>Speaking at a symposium held by Kadokawa ASCII Research Institute on 27 September 2013, the chairman of the board of directors of Kadokawa Group Holdings, Tsuguhiko Kadokawa, stated that despite the game's popularity, Kantai Collection is nearly unprofitable for the company, in part due to the game being funded by various company partnerships. Kadokawa's stock price rose by 1000 yen within June 2013, following the initial rise of the game. It is expected that Kadokawa will need to rely on sales of intellectual property media works such as books and manga in order to raise profits. Kadokawa Games president Yoshimi Yasuda affirms that the free-to-play business model of the game will not change despite reports of a lack of revenue gain.</p>
            <p id="reception_end">Tsukiji Toshihiko's light novel Kantai Collection: Kagerō, Setting Sail! sold 16,624 copies within its first week of release, placing 11th place within the Oricon book ranking charts.

            <h3 id="politic">Political commentary</h3>
            <p id="gallery_pre">An editorial within the South Korean Hankook Ilbo on 4 November 2013 accuses that the strong popularity of the game is due to a conservative political shift amongst young people in Japan following long-term economic recession and political instability, and that the game majestifies the wartime Imperial Japanese Navy. Addressing the Hankook Ilbo allegation, Akky Akimoto writing for The Japan Times disagrees with the idea that the game's design deliberately facilitates any political shift, and argues that the 1970s anime series Space Battleship Yamato was subject to similar criticisms despite having little effect on domestic politics.</p>
